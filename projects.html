                    <em> Project Overview</em>
                    <br />
                    Brainshuttle, a Germany-based education technology company,
                    engaged me to design and develop a new website that aligned
                    with their mission, vision, and evolving product offerings.
                    The goal was to modernize their digital presence, streamline
                    content delivery, and create a platform that could grow
                    alongside the company.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <em> My Role </em>
                    <br />

                    I acted as lead developer and designer, overseeing every
                    stage of the process from concept and wireframing to
                    implementation and optimization. I reported directly to
                    C-suite executives, ensuring strategic alignment at each
                    milestone.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <em>The Process</em>
                    <br />

                    Using an agile development approach, I translated brand
                    guidelines into a responsive, accessible, and visually
                    engaging interface. I implemented a custom WordPress CMS for
                    easy content management, refined the site’s UI/UX for
                    intuitive navigation, and optimized hosting infrastructure
                    for performance and scalability.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <em>Impact</em>
                    <br />

                    The project delivered a fully functional, scalable, and
                    brand-aligned web platform, setting the stage for future
                    growth and user engagement. This work highlighted my ability
                    to integrate technical expertise with design sensitivity
                    while collaborating effectively across international teams.
                    <br />
                    * Due to the confidential nature of this project, I’m unable

                    <em>Confidential Project Overview</em>
                    <br />
                    As Design Director for an early-stage neuroscience startup,
                    I played a pivotal role in shaping both the company’s public
                    identity and its flagship product experience. XB Innovation
                    was founded by a group of ambitious students, a PhD
                    candidate, and close collaborators with a vision to
                    revolutionize laboratory work in academia and
                    neuroscience-focused industries. From inception, I worked
                    side-by-side with founders, researchers, and engineers to
                    create a brand and product experience that could communicate
                    highly complex research in an accessible, compelling, and
                    scientifically rigorous way for both investors and the
                    scientific community.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <em> My Role </em>
                    <br />
                    I oversaw the creation of the brand’s visual identity—logo,
                    color palette, typography, and cohesive design system—while
                    directing UX for the company’s inaugural software product. I
                    also developed narrative-driven pitch materials, ensuring
                    visual storytelling aligned with business strategy and
                    research credibility.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <em>The Process</em>
                    <br />

                    Partnering with neuroscientists and engineers, I conducted
                    in-depth user needs analysis, turning raw research insights
                    into clear design requirements. Using tools like Figma,
                    Miro, and Notion, I prototyped and refined app layouts and
                    experimental tool interfaces. I led cross-functional design
                    sprints, facilitated stakeholder reviews, and ensured brand
                    consistency across platforms, while managing workflows
                    through Notion, Trello, and Monday.com.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <em>Impact</em>
                    <br />
                    While the final designs and product details remain under
                    NDA, my work was instrumental in helping the company secure
                    seed funding and establish itself as a credible innovator in
                    the neurotech space. This project stands as one of the most
                    complex, multidisciplinary, and rewarding challenges of my
                    career.
                    <br />
